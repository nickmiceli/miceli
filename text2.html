    <h3 class="main-h3">6 Things That Made Me Fall In Love with Reading</h3>
    <p class="main-p">I've read more books in 2024 than I have throughout my life.</p>
    <p class="main-p">I wish this was an exaggeration, but reading was never my forte. The only book I remember partly liking throughout school was 1984 by George Orwell. Although I think I only enjoyed reading that because it wasn’t Shakespeare like we read previously.</p>
    <p class="main-p">I started dabbling with reading more in 2023 as a way to try and be more productive and help me get into a better nighttime routine. I tried to read at least 10 pages a day. Some days it was easy and others it was hard. Overall I enjoyed reading the few books I had but the interest quickly died and I had stopped reading all together.</p>
    <p class="main-p">That is until I met my lovely girlfriend, the only reader of this blog post.</p>
    <p class="main-p">Seeing her passion for reading made me want to give it another try. I had kind of grown to miss reading and was looking to get back into it before we started talking, but after we got together it cemented the decision. Then one day we laid together on the couch to read, thus starting my current reading journey. </p>
    <p class="main-p">I have grown to love many different aspects about reading. Here are a few of the most important reasons to me</p>

    <h4 class="main-h4">Guilt Free Hobby</h4>
    <p class="main-p">This one is kind of silly sounding, but its important to me. I’ve always struggled to mentally balance hobbies. A lot of my hobbies consist of things that make me feel guilty or like I’m wasting time, although I know that isn’t entirely true. Relaxing and watching a show for a few hours can do wonders for your mental health. Hobbies don’t have to be productive activities in themselves, I know this. But something that I love about reading is it doesn’t make me feel like I’m wasting time.</p>
    <p class="main-p">I’m not sure if the reasoning is because I am using my brain or if its because there are no screens involved or something else entirely. I never feel wrong for sitting down and reading for an hour, even if I had different intentions on how to spend my time. My brain still feels like its active and I am accomplishing something.</p>
    <p class="main-p">Of course there are other guilt free hobbies I enjoy, such as wood working or programming a microcontroller to flash a bright light in my eyes for every follow I get on Twitch. Reading is just low effort and easy to pick up and put down. A lot of other hobbies almost require time to be set aside to get fully immersed and enjoy them, but I can pick up a book at any moment and enjoy the time spent right away.</p>

    <h4 class="main-h4">Great Stories</h4>
    <p class="main-p">This one is kind of obvious to most people, but damn when an author is cooking it is so hard to put a book down. I’m sure we have all heard someone say “The book is way better than the movie”, and there is definitely reason for that. Author’s can put an excruciating amount of detail into such a small un-important scene to create this beautiful world their story takes place in. While movies have both a time constraint and a monetary budget. </p>
    <p class="main-p">Without going into more detail about why movies are generally worse, the main point I wanted to get across is that the environments created are so immersive. I have found myself at various moments rooting for a certain thing to happen to a character I like, or one that I didn’t. </p>
    <p class="main-p">I have only read a handful of books this year, most notably being books 1-3 of the Dark Tower series by Stephen King. The world that is created within these three books has me drawn in so deep. Book three introduces a character named Oy, who is a small animal companion to one of the main characters. There was a scene where Oy was in danger and I swear if Steve had decided to kill Oy right then and there I would have sent him hate mail. </p>
    <p class="main-p">I can rarely get immersed in a story enough to feel genuine emotion, but there is something about a good book that pulls that out of me so easily.</p>

    <h4 class="main-h4">Escape From Reality</h4>
    <p class="main-p">This is kind of the entire point of a hobby right? Trying to get away from your normal everyday life? </p>
    <p class="main-p">I was always hesitant that reading would actually be able to pull me away from reality. Even during the first few books I read I would find my mind wandering off about things unrelated. It was only recently that I learned that I really am able to let books distract me, and this finding was revolutionary.</p>
    <p class="main-p">It was happening during most books I read this year I was just bad at realizing it. After starting The Waste Lands, and reading half the book in two days, I thought to myself “Did I just use a book to escape my current feelings?” The answer was yes. I did just use a book to escape my current feelings.</p>
    <p class="main-p">At the beginning it was kind of hard for me to read 10 pages a day. Now I sit down, blink, and have been reading for an hour. It’s honestly wonderful.</p>

    <h4 class="main-h4">Bonding With My Girlfriend</h4>
    <p class="main-p">This is one of the biggest pushes to get me into reading in general. My girlfriend loves reading and kept asking if we could have a “reading date” where we just cuddle up and read together. I wanted to be able to enjoy these things with her and “reading dates” sounded wonderful. It also gives me a solid excuse to start reading again. </p>
    <p class="main-p">Although up until this point I have been blindly following her suggestions on books to read, and they have all been really good, I’m almost at a point where I know different genres and what I like/dislike. We have been able to have some genuine discussions about different books and its so much fun!</p>
    <p class="main-p">Every time I read a chapter in a book that makes me heated I just put down the book, and find her to rant about it. She enjoys these moments (I think) and it allows me to better judge what books/authors I enjoy or not. It’s fun reading some of her favorite stories and connecting with her about them, or reading something I think is stupid and forcing a TED Talk upon her.</p>
    <p class="main-p">She is able to do the same with me as well. Like she can, and does, share her hatred for poorly written sex scenes in YA novels. And now, as an experienced reader, I can understand and relate to these annoyances more than before. </p>
    <p class="main-p">It’s fun sharing a hobby with someone you love, at least until we inevitably disagree on something.</p>

    <h4 class="main-h4">Learning New Words/Writing Skills</h4>
    <p class="main-p">This point is pretty small overall but it is still something that brings me enjoyment. Reading more books exposes me to all sorts of new vocabulary, lots of which I have never heard of and have no clue what they mean. It makes it kind of fun to stumble across a mysterious word that you have never heard before and looking it up. Maybe I’ll even remember some for future use.</p>
    <p class="main-p">It also exposes me to different styles of writing which is a ton of fun. I’ve only ever read my own style of writing, or the half assed high school essay effort of writing. Seeing how someone like Stephen King can create such a vivid and expansive world in his books while making it so interesting makes reading a ton of fun and almost gives me more ideas how to improve my own writing.</p>
    <p class="main-p">I don’t really have an urge to write anything, but it has helped me at least understand what styles of writing I enjoy.</p>

    <h4 class="main-h4">Collecting Books</h4>
    <p class="main-p">This is an awful reason to enjoy any hobby (outside of collecting as a hobby), but I enjoy the aesthetic of full bookshelves. I also think having a bookshelf full of books that you have read is cool and like a little time capsule. Like anyone can point to a book and you can be like “Yeah this was awful”.</p>
    <p class="main-p">I would absolutely love to have a little library in my future home with a cozy ass chair or two and just vibe the fuck out every once in a while. Stories are fun to read and share, and I would love to do both of those whenever I can. </p>
    <p class="main-p">Its lame, but collecting books looks fun and I want to buy more. </p>

    <hr>

    <p class="main-p">I’ve enjoyed my reading journey so far, although it is young it is also bright. There are countless stories out there that I cannot wait to read. As well as countless “reading dates” I cannot wait to go on. Im excited to see how many books I end up reading this year! My goal is 12, or one a month. </p>
    <p class="main-p">I’m also very excited to finish The Dark Tower series by Stephen King. So far it has been fantastic and I am dying to know how it ends. I have never read a series like this and although it can be exhausting at times the major plot points always hit really hard. </p>
    <p class="main-p">There are plenty of other books I can’t wait to read. I also can’t wait to find my genres and dive into some more hidden gems. I dream of the day I can walk into a library and confidently pick out a book. We’re getting closer to that point, slowly but surely.</p>
    <p class="main-p" id="bottom-p">What are your favorite things about reading? What are you reading right now? I would love to know!</p>
