    <h3 class="main-h3">An Awful Review of The Dark Tower Books 1-3</h3>
    <p class="main-p">Hi!</p>
    <p class="main-p">I really struggled to come up with an idea that I actually liked for todays little gift. I wrote out three different ideas and ended up scrapping them all. I finally came up with an idea that I think is good enough, so I hope you enjoy reading it! Here is my more comprehensive, very unprofessional review of books 1-3 of The Dark Tower series by Stephen King.</p>  

    <h4 class="main-h4">Book 1: The Gunslinger</h4>
    <p class="main-p">I want to start this by saying that I have never read a series before (outside of skimming books one and two of The Hunger Games in middle school) and I have never read any book by Stephen King. This was my first experience reading a book by an author who is as talented as he is. I had no idea what to expect and honestly my expectations were probably higher than they should’ve been.</p>
    <p class="main-p">Overall I think I really enjoyed The Gunslinger. It was rather short in comparison to books two and three, but it did a good job of setting up the story to come. I was intrigued by who this “Gunslinger” was and his true motive. I don’t think he was ever mentioned by name until he met Jake at the Waystation. The lack of details regarding the plot while this world was being painted all around was incredibly fun to read. All we knew is that Roland had to catch this man in black, but that was it. Nothing else.</p>
    <p class="main-p">The man in black was such a mysterious character that I absolutely loved. Roland was trailing so far behind the man in black yet it almost seemed like he wanted Roland to catch up to him. He left subtle clues about the direction he was headed and started slowing his pace. Why was he doing this and how did he know about Roland? It was clear he knew WHO was trailing him. There was intent behind all of this, but why?</p>
    <p class="main-p">I think the first moment that made me step back and really think about what I just read was the introduction of Jake. Not only was he a lone kid, but he came from a different world. He came from our world. This immediately made me put the book down and think about what it happening. Is Rolands world completely separate or is it still our Earth but set far into the future or past? Of course nothing was really explained so I was just left with a ton of questions, which I loved. </p>
    <p class="main-p">The rest of the book was pretty average until they caught the man in black. The underground train station was kind of interesting as it was another connection between Rolands world and our own but it didn’t really catch me. I was honestly shocked when Jake ended up dying at the end though. I really though he would’ve lasted a little longer than like 120 pages. It also kind of showed how cold Roland can be and how hypnotized he was by his own journey to reach the Dark Tower.</p>
    <p class="main-p">I don’t know what I expected the man in black to be like, but I was not right at all. The way he spoke annoyed me so much. He was so cocky and just toying around with everyone. I wanted to know his secrets but I also wanted him dead. The drawing of the cards also flew right over my head. I was sitting there like this is kinda cool and I’m sure theres some foreshadowing here. Then just kept reading with no extra thought. The ending of the book still kind of confused me with whatever astral projection bullshit he was spewing and then just dies? But its okay, Roland got a replacement jaw bone for his pocket.</p>
    <p class="main-p">I was left craving more but also intimidated by the thought of reading a 500 page book next. Book one answered almost none of my questions and just opened up dozens more. There was no way I could stop reading after that introduction.</p>

    <h4 class="main-h4">Book 2: The Drawing of the Three</h4>
    <p class="main-p">Book two was fantastic. It had its low points, which I will get to shortly, but overall I did not predict any events in this book correctly. Which is something I value a ton because I love twists and turns in stories. I started this book pretty slowly but once it was getting good I absolutely crushed it. </p>
    <p class="main-p">It starts off pretty much where the previous book ended, on the beach. Immediately there is a new enemy introduced, the lobstrosities. I always just pictured these guys as Larry the Lobster from Spongebob. They were interesting and seemed almost innocent. With the way they talked it seemed like they were just clueless little guys hanging out on the beach. Until they almost killed Roland.</p>
    <p class="main-p">Holy shit I was not expecting Roland to lose multiple fingers within the first 30 pages of this book. He is a gunslinger, THE gunslinger. How can he just lose multiple fingers on his dominate hand?? Then I started getting worried about the blood loss and infection. He isn’t living in our world where he is almost guaranteed to live from something like that. He is alone with no medicine or help. I was worried we were about to lose our guy at the beginning of book two.</p>
    <p class="main-p">Then Roland stumbled across the first door labelled as The Prisoner (OMG that was one of the cards from the end of last book? Maybe there was some foreshadowing involved there!). The only thing my brain could think of for these doors is that it would be a direct portal somewhere and he would have to find the prisoner. To my delight, I was wrong. The door opened to a private movie theater showing one long movie, POV of a heroin addict in New York. I was caught so off guard when Roland entered this move theater, well his soul? entered this movie theater, and he was inside the mind of someone else. Absolutely genius. </p>
    <p class="main-p">I loved this idea so much. How Roland was able to observe and make commentary in this strangers mind but could also take over if he wanted to. Eddie’s situation of being a drug mule on an airplane was so exhilarating to read. How were they going to get out of this situation? How would Eddie let Roland save him while not going insane for thinking theres another man in his head? How is the pound of cocaine going to just disappear? I seriously read so fast during this part it really grabbed me full force. I thought it was going to end once he was off the plane but then he had to fight against all the officers at the airport AND against the drug lord who was expecting his arrival. </p>
    <p class="main-p">The shootout at the end felt inevitable but Roland coming through to Eddie’s world to help fight was crazy. He was able to grab some medicine and Eddie then returned back to his world. Crisis averted and Roland has a new friend! His new friend was not very friendly at first, which makes sense from someone who is withdrawing from heroin and in a foreign world. Together they continued the trek down the beach trying to find the second door.</p>
    <p class="main-p">Introducing The Lady of Shadows, and my least favorite section of this book. The name Lady of Shadows is super ominous and mysterious so I was expecting something more than Odetta/Detta/Susannah I guess. I also was not expecting a character with no legs at any point, like what a random twist. But I enjoyed how quickly they just yanked her into Roland’s world and kept the trek moving. At first I enjoyed the whole Detta situation with her basically sabotaging everything. But then it just didn’t stop. I swear a third of this book was the same loop of Roland slowly dying and Detta making everything difficult. It was a little long for my professional taste.</p>
    <p class="main-p">It did add some suspense knowing that there was a mentally ill character who actively wanted to kill the other two main characters. Especially with Eddie battling his own demons and Roland, well slowly dying to this infection. The journey was slow but eventually the third door was found, and it was almost too late. Roland was literally about to croak any day now. Except this third door didn’t contain the name from one of the cards the man in black drew, but had the super scary name “The Pusher”. I kinda giggled when they hyped up this evil name for a while and then its like a dude who pushed you at recess or something. Damn he sounds scary, better be careful in there. </p>
    <p class="main-p">The third door was pretty eventful. Eddie had fallen in love with Odetta and wanted to free her from Detta’s grasp. He was actively looking for the runaway psychotic cripple with a gun while Roland was in the door with his soulless body laying unconscious on the beach. So there was the suspense of what Detta is going to do, if she if gonna kill Roland while he lay defenseless, or Eddie who was looking for her, or both. All while we find out that the character in the third door was not only the person who pushed Jake to his initial death mentioned in book one, but also the reason Odetta/Detta/Susannah lost her legs AND got hit in the head with a brick. This was actually a super cool twist.</p>
    <p class="main-p">I enjoyed watching Roland traverse around New York trying to get ammunition and medicine without getting caught. The way he went about doing it too was super smart and kind of crazy. I’m always surprised that Mort played along and just let this happen all while giving Roland all the information he needed when he faced a tough situation. Eventually Roland scooped up a ton of drugs and a ton of bullets leaving behind a wake of chaos. Alright time to bring Mort through the portal!</p>
    <p class="main-p">No. It was time for Roland to get revenge for his friends. Like what?? What a cool ending to this section. He figured out who Mort actually was and went through all the trouble to cut off Morts legs and get him killed. I loved that so much. </p>
    <p class="main-p">Eventually Roland made it back into his own world with his goodies and just in time to save himself and Eddie from Detta and Larry the Lobster. I don’t remember what exactly happened but I know that Odetta and Detta like merged into who we now call Susannah. Cool, I’m glad that part is over with too. </p>
    <p class="main-p">Book two was a really fun read and left me wanting to know what was going to happen next. Obviously they were seeking the Dark Tower,  but we know nothing about the tower at all. I wanted to know, so I kept reading.</p>

    <h4 class="main-h4">Book 3: The Wastelands</h4>
    <p class="main-p">My expectations were low for this book. I read the ending blurb after book two which mentioned that this book was about half of the remaining journey to the Dark Tower. So i didn’t expect much to really happen at all. Well I was wrong, this book was also amazing. </p>
    <p class="main-p">The first mind fuck of the book was this weird, massive, parasite infested, robot bear thing. Alright, new enemy race introduced here. I guess there is some bigger power who is creating these robots, that is actually kind of sick. The bear introduced so many questions into my head about what the hell was going on in this world. This was the first bit of “technology” we have seen in Rolands world, and it was fascinating. I also loved how Roland forced Susannah to kill the bear in a do or die scenario. Her growth in that moment was fun to read and extremely stressful.</p>
    <p class="main-p">Then we met the lord and savior, Mr. Beam. The invisible beam of energy that was a direct line to the Dark Tower. I actually liked the whole idea of there being 12 “portals” that surround the tower and connect to each other with this beam. So they set out on the path of the beam in hopes to one day reach the tower. </p>
    <p class="main-p">Roland also began to lose his mind. He was struggling to accept the death of Jake and questioning if it really happened or not. Did the boy exist or not exist? He was losing his heightened senses and became useless for a little while. He even handed over his gun and knife to Eddie as he feared what he might do with it in his possession. </p>
    <p class="main-p">Eddie kept having these weird dreams that would show him this specific key and reference a rose. He struggled to make sense of these symbols or why these dreams were so vivid. He knew the key was special and needed to open some door, but what door and when? What about the rose? It’s a good thing Eddie conveniently has wood carving skills so he can carve this key out of a tree branch!</p>
    <p class="main-p">Then out of no where we are re-introduced to Jake, who is back in New York and also starting to lose his mind. WAIT WHAT? WHY BRING HIM BACK INTO THIS STORY? ISN’T HE DEAD? I immediately was like theres no way he comes back. I would love that but theres no way. He was writing cryptic essays about Roland and the dark tower and someone named Blaine? His dreams were mirroring those of Eddie. There were too many connections here for Jake to not make it back into the weird world of Roland and I am all for it.</p>
    <p class="main-p">I loved this. I really loved all of this. Eddie having these vivid dreams while having to take over as leader of the trio since Roland was going insane. Jake losing his mind and creepily following these visions and voices he would hear. I was hesitant my theory was right until Jake stumbled across the rose and key in that empty dirt lot. The rose full of a tiny sun, and this random key that perfectly matched the one that Eddie had seen. Then the voice told him to meet at a certain place tomorrow at 3 pm. Shit was about to go down, or he was about to get hooked on heroin. Both are just as exciting!</p>
    <p class="main-p">Eddie figured out his side of the puzzle and they were ready to perform the ritual which would allow Jake the come hang out again. Jake made it to the location he was told to go to and found.. younger Eddie and Henry. What a fucking cool event. He followed them to the haunted mansion and Jake knew the door he needed was inside there. What I didn’t expect was the house to literally start shape shifting and try to kill him. This was so creepy to read, then I remember Stephen King also writes spooky books. Yeah he is good at that, I was pretty spooked. </p>
    <p class="main-p">Eventually Jake was rescued through the door and they were all reunited. I loved this arc so much. It without question is my favorite arc in a book that I have read. It was written so well and just kept me absolutely craving more. The ONLY thing I do not understand is the Oracle being a sex maniac. Like Rolands pep talk to Susannah being “Alright, this thing is gonna want to rape one of us endlessly so be ready to just sit there and let it happen while we rescue a child.” I was like uh okay but why? I literally googled Oracle and read about them because if there is a mythological tie to Oracle and sex then I’ll shut up. But there isn’t. King just decided it would be more entertaining for Susannah to be raped instead of literally anything else. Interesting choice.</p>
    <p class="main-p">I literally JUST thought of this while writing that last paragraph. What if Susannah is pregnant with a little Oracle baby? That might be the only saving grace to her pregnancy but I honestly don’t remember if she missed her period before or after they rescued Jake. I don’t see any other situation where this child birth doesn’t make me angry.</p>
    <p class="main-p">After Jake was back the story was kinda mid for a bit. Outside of my favorite character being introduced, Oy, the only event that happened was this first small city they found. This small arc gave us some pretty good information but it didn’t hold my attention well. Luckily it was short.</p>
    <p class="main-p">The Lud arc was interesting to say the least. I overall enjoyed it but I was so uneasy and uncomfortable reading it for some reason. I guess the arc starting with a disgusting rotting man stealing Jake and calling him his sweet little boycunt was part of it. I think I was worried that Jake was gonna be kidnapped for too long and that Roland would really struggle to rescue him. Once again, luckily I was wrong. </p>
    <p class="main-p">The Tick Tock man was a super interesting character as well. He was similar strength and speed to Roland, finally someone can rival the gunslinger. I wanted to know more about the information this man held and why he was named Tick Tock man. I really didn’t expect him to “die” as quick as he did. I also was SO CLOSE to throwing hands. If Oy was killed I was going to be livid. I’m glad this part wasn’t super long.</p>
    <p class="main-p">Eddie and Susannahs journey was a little different. They had to fight through a death ridden street and lie through their teeth to some creepy people. Fortunately their bluff was not called and they were lead to the place they sought after. The choo choo train! I love the imagery of this rotten gross city with this magnificent, clean structure that no one dared to enter. With a large statue of what seemed to be a gunslinger, or maybe even Roland on top? I was curious as to what was going to happen when they reached Blaine. Supposedly he was this train who killed a ton of people and the just waltz up the stairs and knock on his door.</p>
    <p class="main-p">I overall like Blaine and how he is this supercomputer that controls so much of the city. Although I was not a fan of his dialogue. By the time they all got aboard the train I was like alright Mr. Tough Guy you can stop talking now. Yet he continued to flex his muscles until Roland put him in his place.  </p>
    <p class="main-p">Book three was very good and potentially my favorite of the three I had read. I truly did not expect to be this invested into this series. Part of me was worried that I wasn’t going to like it and let you down. But I love it so far! I seriously cannot wait to finish it!</p>
    <p class="main-p">I hope you enjoyed this lengthy and poorly written “review” of my experience with these books. I hope it wasn’t too boring and wasn’t a drag to finish reading. I tried to not go into extreme detail but I have a lot to say, and will continue to have more to say as I keep reading.</p>
    <p class="main-p">I also want to thank you for re-introducing me to reading as well as introducing me to this series. I am loving it so far and excited for the rest! I’m also starting to become quite to reader over here. Gonna have to start a booktube channel soon!</p>
    <p class="main-p" id="bottom-p">Anyways I hope you have a good day or night or whatever it is! I love you so much!</p>
